\section{Motivation and Problem Definition}

\todo{Upravit podle toho, co bude skutečně v kapitole \ref{chap_mas}}

We have already reviewed the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm and its parallelization in
 Chapter \ref{chap_mcts} and distributed coordination algorithms and in Chapter \ref{chap_mas}.




\section{Comparison Measures}
\label{sec_measures_distributed}

We have already described measures suitable for plain Monte-Carlo Tree Search and parallel
Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Section \ref{sec_measures_parallel}. We will show that these
measures are also suitable for comparison of distributed MCTS algorithms for games with team
of cooperating agents. In addition, we will compare the amount of communication needed by the
algorithms and the robustness of the algorithms against communication failures. For such
comparisons, we will evaluate strength measures depending on the amount of communication and
its robustness. The amount of communication will be simply the total length of messages
exchanged. Some environments (e.g. radio transmissions or Ethernet over coax) provide the 
possibility of broadcasting messages for the cost of passing single message whereas others 
don't so the cost of broadcasted message equals to the cost of separate messages to all
receivers. We will distinguish between these
environments since some of the algorithms advantage from cheap message broadcasting.

We have described two classes of measures for parallel MCTS, \emph{strength-} and
\emph{simulations-per second-}based measures. Former one works with score obtained at the end
of a game and latter one counts number of MCTS iterations handled per time unit. Details of
these measures are discussed in Section \ref{sec_measures_parallel}. Obviously we can use
simulations-per-second measures, distribution is not obstacle, simulations are still performed
and these measures show the computational costs of distribution of computation. Similar is the
case of strength measures where the only difference is that agents decide the actions
independently but from outer point of view the joint action is the same as if plain or parallel
MCTS calculate action. Strength measures say how strong is team guided by an algorithm.
