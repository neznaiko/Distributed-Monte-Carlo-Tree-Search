\chapter{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}

This chapter describes Monte-Carlo Tree Search (referred as MCTS (!)) algorithm and discusses its properties.
The algorithm serves for searching wolrd states in fully visible environment using incrementally growing state tree and stochastic simulations for evaluation of states.
