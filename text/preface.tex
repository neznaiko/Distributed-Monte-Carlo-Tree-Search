Problem of the coordination of a team of agents is widely discussed topic.
Designing of algorithms for such a coordination meets various difficulties 
including positional information interchanging, distribution of plan computation, 
communication reliability or system failures.

Monte-Carlo Tree Search is a best-first search algorithm which has
reached unprecedent results in playing a game of Go.
Accordingly to the proven qualities of the algorithms further works have
been dealing with it finding applications of the algorithm in various
domains.
Recently a work on team coordination using MCTS has been published by
Nguyen and Thawonmas \cite{Nguyen2011}.
MCTS is applied to controlling a team of ghosts in well-known Pacman
game in this paper.
Their computer player won the CEC 2011 Ms Pac-Man vs Ghost Team
Competition \cite{PacmanVsGhosts}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Nguien's ghosts runs simple instance of algorithm sharing tree
over all agents in team, no communication needed since joint moves are
calculated and passed to the environment
\item Our aim is to develop algorithms based on MCTS giving the autonomy
to agents what brings necessity of communication between agents
\item We consider the domain of Ms Pac-Man vs Ghost Team Competition
suitable for evaluation of the algorithms because the game of Ms Pac-Man
is well-known, frame
\item
\end{itemize}
